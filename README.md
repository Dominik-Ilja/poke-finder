# Poke Finder

## Description
Poke Finder allows you to search for any of the 905 available Pokemon! This is done by accessing Pokemon information available through the free to use [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/])! You'll be able to see any of your favorite Pokemon in our beautiful light or dark modes. Enjoy!

### Searching
Searching is done on the **Pokedex** page. 

On this page we can search are list of Pokemon by typing into our search bar. This will update our list in real time allowing you to see all the matches of your search. But wait, there's more! We have another layer of filtering that will only show a Pokemon of a specific type. This is done by selecting any one of the 18 Pokemon types below our search bar.

Yes, these two types of filters do work in unison. You can filter by type then get even more specific by using the search bar.

### Selecting Pokemon
Once you've found the Pokemon you want, simply click on the list item and you'll be taken to its page. Every page is dynamically rendered using React Router. Using Axios to get more information from the PokeAPI, we are now able to see things such as : evolution line, stats, description, etc.

If you wish to see the next or previous Pokedex entries at the bottom of the page our links that'll take you to those pages.
